      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a very very long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted anything publicly. Blogging has drastically changed since the early days. As most of you, I consume a lot of material and resources on the internet. For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to contribute back&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m constantly learning new things and some of them are really useful. So, this is my way to hopefully help others.
With that, my inaugural post will be on how I set up this blog.</description>
