      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a book for Packt publishing titled Serverless Design Patterns and Best Practices.
While writing and whipping out tons of examples is quite a bit of work, and I sometimes curse myself for agreeing to this, I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited as I work through the chapters and as it comes together.
The first three chapters in the book cover different patterns for web applications. In two of these three sections, the logical layer of a 3-tier web application (Presentation, Data, and Logical layers) is, of course, Serverless.</description>

      <title>How to setup a free SSL certificate for use with Serverless APIs</title>
      <link>http://blog.brianz.bz/post/custom-https-domains-with-serverless/</link>

      <description>NOTE!!!
 As of March 2017 this post is no longer relevant. AWS has updated API Gateway so that you can get a free certificate using AWS Certificate Manager. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this up for historical purposes but if you need SSL for API Gateway on your own domain please have a look at the Certificate Manager integration&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy!
 If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this blog it will become very obvious I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of the Serverless framework to power AWS Lambda and API Gateway integration.</description>

      <description>Since my last posts on Serverless, Serverless has gone 1.0. In fact, as of this writing Serverless is at version 1.3. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the luck of taking 1.3 for a spin with my new job by implementing an application for the Amazon Alexa platform. Alexa has a really nice integration with Lambda and we&amp;rsquo;ve been using Serverless to do our Lambda development. Our development pace has been insanely high and much of that can be attributed to Serverless.</description>

      <description>Welcome to part four in my series about Serverless. As a reminder, there are now three other parts you can read if you aren&amp;rsquo;t coming here from those posts already:
 Serverless Part I Serverless Part II Serverless Part III  In the previous posts I worked through some of the basics of Serverless and stood up an API endpoint which returned HTML. Now I&amp;rsquo;d like to start working through some more real-world examples and talk through some warts I&amp;rsquo;ve found with Serverless.</description>

      <description>This is part three in my series about creating serverless systems using AWS API Gateway + Lambda via the Serverless project. If you&amp;rsquo;re haven&amp;rsquo;t already you can read part I and part II.
My goal is to continue evolving this example to walk through a non-trivial example of doing something with the serverless architecture. Along the way I&amp;rsquo;ll demo some useful features which you&amp;rsquo;ll undoubtedly run into when doing real development with Serverless.</description>

      <description>Following up from my last post about serverless systems, let&amp;rsquo;s do a walk-through of the Serverless project.
Getting started As usual I&amp;rsquo;ll demo this using a Docker container. You can check out the code on Github and follow along: https://github.com/brianz/serverless-demo.
This Docker image has Serverless v0.5.5&amp;hellip;and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. I use a basic Makefile to build and run the container. You can take a look at it yourself and change the container name if you&amp;rsquo;d like to follow along.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty exciting (and challenging) time to build software-based applications. Every week there are more and more tools to make our jobs easier or to enable us to focus on application development rather than dealing with the infrastructure around those applications. Of course, this makes our jobs challenging since we need to keep up with the innovation.
This will be part one of a multi-part series about &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; architecture/design.</description>
