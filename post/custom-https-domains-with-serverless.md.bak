If you're reading this blog it will become very obvious I'm a big fan of the [Serverless
framework](https://serverless.com) to power AWS Lambda and API Gateway integration.

When building _real_ APIs that you'd like to deploy publicly one thing you'll run into eventually
is that of setting up a custom domain name. API Gateway is fantastic and you can get up and running
in a hurry, exposing a publicly facing API running over SSL. However, the chances of you actually
wanting to use the AWS-provided URL is slim to nil. Do you really want to publish a public API with
the format of: 

```
https://abcxszhmwi.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev
```

No. You don't.

In this post I'll use my [Dilbert Slack plugin]({{< ref "post/serverless-1.0.md" >}}) which I built
in a prior post (and which I'm still running on a few different Slack channels). What we'll do is
set up a custom domain with SSL so that `https://dilbert.brianz.bz` works just the same as the
default API Gateway URL.

What is even better...we'll do this for **FREE** using a completely legitimate certificate
authority so that our certs don't raise any warnings for users.
Because we're going to be doing this with open source 
software there are a few hoops to jump through...but not that many.  If you feel like shelling out a few
hundred dollars to buy a domain from a certificate authority the process would be super
simple...but that's no fun.  This process is simple enough that I don't know why anyone shells out
the money for an SSL cert these days (unless you need a wildcard domain...more about that in 
[at the end of this post]({{< relref "#summary" >}})).

## Overview

Here is the overall process we'll use.  First, the tools which I use to accomplish this:

- Docker (not required, but handy)
- [`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org)
- DNS zone file

The secret sauce in getting a free SSL certificate is `certbot` from the Electric Frontier
Foundation.

And the steps which I'll cover in detail:

- Spin up Docker container using `python:2` image
- Install `certbot` in container
- Run `certbot` in container
- Change DNS records as instructed by `certbot` to verify domain
- Create a "Custom Domain" in API Gateway and Install certificate files 
- Update your DNS records to point to your new Cloudfront distribution

To be clear, there are definitely other ways to accomplish this. This is actually my second
iteration of this process which is easier than my first implementation.
For my purposes I've found this process to be quite easy and painless. One caveat with `certbot`
certificates is that they expire after only three months. This process is so simple I don't think
it's a big deal to do it four times a year.  Sure...if you're managing dozens of domains it could
get cumbersome, but for a handful of domains it's not a huge deal.

## Getting started

`certbot` has many different options and methods for validating that you own the domain for which you're
requesting a domain. I have found that the easiest validation method is via DNS. Other challenge
methods require running an HTTP server on some publicly accessible host. This *used* to be the
method I used where I'd spin up a nano EC2 instance, run a simple `HTTPServer` via Python and have
it serve a some file in response to the HTTP request from `certbot`. The DNS challenge is much
simpler...all it requires is adding an `TXT` record without the need to run any additional systems
or software.

I'm using Docker for all this since it's so easy. `certbot` is installable via `pip`, however
there are several system dependencies you'll need. Because it's so easy with Docker it's my
suggested method for using `certbot`. Here's a two line `Dockerfile` which will work:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:2
RUN pip install certbot
```

It's really that easy.

My accompanying `Makefile`:

```Makefile
NAME="bz/certbot"

.PHONY: all shell

all :
	docker build -t $(NAME) .

shell :
	docker run --rm -it \
		-v `pwd`/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
		$(NAME) bash
```

So now I'll just:

```bash
$ make
$ # lots of output
Removing intermediate container 71cb0a9bbfb9
Successfully built f93119d079ac
$ mkdir letsencrypt
$ make shell
docker run --rm -it \
                -v `pwd`/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
                "bz/certbot" bash
root@ff55a6336d39:/#
```

__Note__: Here I'm creating a *local* directory names `letsencrypt` and mounting in into the
container as `/etc/letsencrypt`. The reason for that is because `certbot` will place all of the
created certificates into `/etc/letsencrypt`. We want any created files to persist on our local
system after the container has been removed.

## Creating the certificate

`certbot` has tight integration with Nginx, Apache and other webservers.  However, I have found these to be more
trouble than they are worth since they will actually attempt to write over your config files or
expect your webserver to be able to serve static content from a path which looks like
`/.well-known/acme-challenge/fhKqLc6FuM97zg3`. 

What I have found to be super easy is the `--manual` method which we'll use here.

In the docker container:

```
# certbot certonly --manual -d dilbert.brianz.bz --preferred-challenge dns
```

What this is saying is:

- `certonly` &rarr; Only get a certificate...don't try to install it for me
- `--manual` &rarr; Use the interactive mode with prompts
- `-d` &rarr; Request a cert for the domain `dilbert.brianz.bz`
- `--preferred-challenges` &rarr; Use DNS for validation rather than a web server

Here is the full output from my run:

```bash
root@271530c5cbad:/certs# certbot certonly --manual -d dilbert.brianz.bz --preferred-challenges dns
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:
dns-01 challenge for dilbert.brianz.bz

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The IP of this machine will be publicly logged as having requested this
certificate. If you're running certbot in manual mode on a machine that is not
your server, please ensure you're okay with that.

Are you OK with your IP being logged?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Y)es/(N)o: Y

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
_acme-challenge.dilbert.brianz.bz with the following value:

tBkgiRMxuIGSKH-WzJiJMTCi5uuEsZUUJJmg8FIBZ40

Once this is deployed,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press Enter to Continue
Waiting for verification...
```

## Create TXT record

This part is easy enough. Simply add a `TXT` record in your DNS zone file as instructed. I'm using
Route53 and this is what it looks like:

![Add TXT record](/images/api-gateway-ssl/route53-txt-record.png)

It may take a bit for this record to propagate.  You can check that it's returning the correct value
using `dig`:

```bash
$ dig -t TXT _acme-challenge.dilbert.brianz.bz
```

## Finishing off challenge

Once your `TXT` record is working, simply hit enter back in the `certbot` prompt:

```bash
Cleaning up challenges
Generating key (2048 bits): /etc/letsencrypt/keys/0000_key-certbot.pem
Creating CSR: /etc/letsencrypt/csr/0000_csr-certbot.pem

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/dilbert.brianz.bz/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2017-05-18. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this
   certificate in the future, simply run certbot again. To
   non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run "certbot
   renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

Nice! Again, you'll notice that `certbot` put the keys in `/etc/letsencrypt`. If you're using
Docker like I am these will now be sitting on your host system. It's now safe to kill the
container.

There are four certificate files created:

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/brianz/dev/certbot/letsencrypt/live/dilbert.brianz.bz
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 brianz  staff  543 Feb 16 16:56 README
lrwxr-xr-x  1 brianz  staff   38 Feb 16 16:56 cert.pem -> ../../archive/dilbert.brianz.bz/cert1.pem
lrwxr-xr-x  1 brianz  staff   39 Feb 16 16:56 chain.pem -> ../../archive/dilbert.brianz.bz/chain1.pem
lrwxr-xr-x  1 brianz  staff   43 Feb 16 16:56 fullchain.pem -> ../../archive/dilbert.brianz.bz/fullchain1.pem
lrwxr-xr-x  1 brianz  staff   41 Feb 16 16:56 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/dilbert.brianz.bz/privkey1.pem
```

## Setting up custom domain with API Gateway

Now that we have our certificate files, it's time to set up a custom domain in API Gateway. How
this will work is the following:

- Create a custom domain in API Gateway and upload certificate files
- Point the new custom domain at the desired API 
- Wait for Cloudfront distribution to complete

First up, navigate to the API Gateway console and click on "Custom Domain Names" followed by the
"Create" button.

Now, you'll need to copy and paste the correct files into the correct locations. The mapping
between `certbot` certificate files and API Gateway Custom Domain form fields is the following:

- `cert.pem` &rarr; Certificate body
- `privkey.pem` &rarr; Certificate private key
- `chain.pem` &rarr; Certificate chain

{{< figure src="/images/api-gateway-ssl/create-custom-domain-name.png" 
    alt="Creating custom domain" 
    caption="Note, this screen-shot is from when I set up a different Custom Domain Name mapping"
>}}

Once you've clicked the Save button it's time to point this domain at a particular API and stage.

For this example it's going to be easy...I'll point the root domain (i.e., `dilbert.brianz.bz`) at
my single `dev` stage for my API.  Click "Create API mapping" an put in:

- Base path &rarr; Leave blank
- API &rarr; Select your desired API distribution
- State &rarr; Select your desired stage

![](/images/api-gateway-ssl/custom-domain-mapping.png)

If you have a more complicated setup, you could do something like the following:

- point `dilbert.brianz.bz/api/dev` to the `dev` stage or `dilbert-dev` Serverless service.
- point `dilbert.brianz.bz/api/qa` to the `qa` stage or `dilbert-qa` Serverless service.
- point `dilbert.brianz.bz/api/` to the `production` stage or `dilbert-production` service.

You get the idea...this is a way to create different environments by pointing URLs at completely
different systems.

Once that is done, you'll be greeted with the following:

{{< figure src="/images/api-gateway-ssl/cloudfront-distribution-creating.png" 
    alt="Cloudfront creat" 
    caption="Again, note this screen-shot is from when I set up a different Custom Domain Name mapping"
>}}

This process really can take a long time.  While the message states "Up to 40 minutes" I've
experienced wait times of several hours.

While you're waiting on that to finishing there's one final thing to do: add a `CNAME` record in
your `DNS` zone file to point your public subdomain (`dilbert.brianz.bz` in this example`) to the
crazy Cloudfront URL created on your behalf. Note, your DNS will likely propagte faster than the
Cloudfront distribution takes to actually set up.

After the wait is over and the Cloudfront distribution is created, we now have a perfectly
valid SSL certificate which I can use for my API.  Hitting https://dilbert.brianz.bz from Slack
works as expected.

## Summary

`certbot` is a great tool to create perfectly valid and completely free ssl certificates. Creating
these certs with the `--manual` method and the `dns` validation method is a simple way to get certs
for use with API Gateway's Custom Domain Name feature. Since these certs expire every three months
you'll need to renew a bit more often than with a paid SSL certificate, however the process isn't
that complicated and in my book the extra work is worth the price savings.

Finally, I should note that `certbot` does not work with wildcard domains. If you have several
subdomains you need certs for your only choice is to shell out the money for a wildcard domain from
one of the commercial CAs.
